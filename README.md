# Finetuning Gemma 2B Model for AI/ML Q&A

## Overview

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the **Gemma 2B model** to answer questions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). By leveraging a pre-trained model and domain-specific datasets, we aim to create a high-performance question-answering system tailored for AI/ML topics.

## Features

- Fine-tuning a pre-trained **Gemma 2B model**.
- Focus on **AI and ML-related questions** for domain-specific expertise.
- Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.
- Provides a framework for further customization and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:

1. **Hardware**: A machine with a GPU (NVIDIA CUDA-supported recommended) for efficient fine-tuning.
2. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.8 or later
   - Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
3. **Python Libraries**:
   - `transformers`
   - `datasets`
   - `torch`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - Additional libraries as specified in the notebook.

## Dataset

The fine-tuning process uses a dataset curated for **AI/ML questions**. Ensure the dataset is structured as follows:
- Input: Question text
- Output: Answer text

Replace the dataset with your own if needed for further experimentation.

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Clone this Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Run the following command to install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook finetuning_of_gemma(aiml_q&a).ipynb
     ```
   - Execute cells sequentially.

4. **Modify Hyperparameters** (Optional):
   Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or epochs within the notebook to optimize performance.

5. **Save the Model**:
   After training, save the fine-tuned model for deployment or further experimentation.

## Output

The fine-tuning process produces:
- A fine-tuned **Gemma 2B model**.
- Evaluation metrics for performance analysis.
- Inference examples showcasing the model's capabilities.
