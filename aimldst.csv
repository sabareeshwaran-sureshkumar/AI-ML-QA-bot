"What Is ‘naive’ in the Naive Bayes Classifier?","The term ‘naive’ refers to the assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label."
"Explain How a System Can Play a Game of Chess Using Reinforcement Learning.","In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to play chess by receiving rewards for good moves and penalties for bad ones, improving its strategy over time."
"How Will You Know Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Choose for Your Classification Problem?","Choose an algorithm based on the size of your dataset, the complexity of the problem, and whether the data is labeled or not."
"How is Amazon Able to Recommend Other Things to Buy? How Does the Recommendation Engine Work?","Amazon uses collaborative filtering and association algorithms to analyze purchase data and suggest products based on user behavior."
"When Will You Use Classification over Regression?","Use classification when the target variable is categorical and regression when it is continuous."
"How Do You Design an Email Spam Filter?","Train a supervised learning model on labeled emails (spam or not spam) using features like keywords, sender information, and content analysis."
"What is a Random Forest?","A random forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and control overfitting."
"Considering a Long List of Machine Learning Algorithms, given a Data Set, How Do You Decide Which One to Use?","Decide based on data size, type (categorical or continuous), problem type (classification, regression, clustering), and the goal of the analysis."
"What is Bias and Variance in a Machine Learning Model?","Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, while variance refers to the error due to excessive complexity in the model."
"What is the Trade-off Between Bias and Variance?","The trade-off involves balancing bias and variance to minimize total error. High bias can lead to underfitting, while high variance can lead to overfitting."
